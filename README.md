# VISUALIZATION AND FORECASTING OF STOCKS USING HISTORICAL DATA

## Introduction


- The goal of the project is to accurately estimate the values of a basket of equities on the NSE/BSE. 
- This study investigated and analysed a range of neural network prediction approaches, and ultimately chose the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory, LSTM) neural network, based on the need for stock price prediction and the practical issues it encounters. 
- The practicality of the procedure and the applicability of the model are then assessed, and a conclusion is reached after an in-depth examination of how to predict stock price using the LSTM. 
- It has been discovered that historical data is particularly significant to investors when making investing decisions. 
- Opening and closing prices have previously been employed as significant new financial market forecasters, but severe maxima and minima may provide extra information regarding future price behaviour.
