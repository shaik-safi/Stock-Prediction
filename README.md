# Stock-Prediction
VISUALIZATION AND FORECASTING OF STOCKS USING HISTORICAL DATA

The goal of the project is to accurately estimate the values of a basket of equities on the NSE/BSE. This study investigated and analysed a range of neural network prediction approaches, and ultimately chose the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory, LSTM) neural network, based on the need for stock price prediction and the practical issues it encounters. The practicality of the procedure and the applicability of the model are then assessed, and a conclusion is reached after an in-depth examination of how to predict stock price using the LSTM. It has been discovered that historical data is particularly significant to investors when making investing decisions. Opening and closing prices have previously been employed as significant new financial market forecasters, but severe maxima and minima may provide extra information regarding future price behaviour.
